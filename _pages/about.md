I am currently employed at the University of Trento (Trento, Italy) as a post-doctoral researcher.
I work on single and multi-objective optimization of transportation problems (e.g., orienteering problems, CVRP, VRPPD, M2MVRP, etc.), and on maintenance scheduling optimization.
I took part to three research projects in collaboration with local companies from February 2022.
During the last two years, I focused my research on learning metaheuristcs, also known as *hyper heuristics*, to embed learning mechanisms when solving combinatorial optimization problems.

Since 2019, I've been a lecturer for the course "Optimization models and algorithms" at the the Dept. of Industrial Engineering of the University of Trento.
Recently, I've been involved in a study about the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory.
