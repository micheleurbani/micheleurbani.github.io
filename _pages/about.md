I am currently employed as researcher at the [Hydrogen technologies and Resilient Energy Systems (HyRES)](https://energy.fbk.eu/home) Unit of [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/it/) (Trento, Italy).
I work on multi-objective optimization and on reduced order models of energy systems.

Previously, I worked on single and multi-objective optimization of transportation problems (e.g., orienteering problems, CVRP, VRPPD, M2MVRP, etc.), and on maintenance scheduling optimization.
During the last two years, I focused my research on learning metaheuristics, also known as *hyper heuristics*, to embed learning mechanisms when solving combinatorial optimization problems.
