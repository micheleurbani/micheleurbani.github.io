abstract = {E-commerce is a continuously growing sector significantly affected by sustainability issues during the last few years. To deal with economic, environmental and social sustainability aspects, e-commerce platforms consolidate orders to pick-up several requests from the same location, defining the so-called Few-to-Many Pick-up and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (F-M VRPPD). The proposed contribution addresses the optimisation of this problem by developing a multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm distinguished by four tailored Local Search (LS) operators specifically developed to increase the probability to identify feasible solutions and decrease the computational time. This algorithm is validated with several instances of a case study e-commerce platform based in an European mountain region. Firstly, the original LS operators are compared to benchmark literature ones to solve identical problems, reporting better performance in 84% of these instances. Furthermore, for the most relevant scenarios significant results are presented and discussed concerning the economic, environmental and social performance of the defined solutions according to the characteristics of the instances, as the routes height profile and the driversâ€™ metabolic energy consumption. The tri-dimensional Pareto frontiers suggest how through a slight worsening in the economic objective function it is possible to improve the social one by up to 18.3% on average.}
