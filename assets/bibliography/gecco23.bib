abstract = {Hyper-heuristics have emerged as a way to raise the level of generality of search techniques for computational search problems. This is in contrast to many approaches, which represent customised methods for a single problem domain or a narrow class of problem instances. The term hyper-heuristic was defined in the early 2000s as a heuristic to choose heuristics, but the idea of designing high-level heuristic methodologies can be traced back to the early 1960s. The current state-of-the-art in hyper-heuristic research comprises a set of methods that are broadly concerned with intelligently selecting or generating a suitable heuristic for a given situation. Hyper-heuristics can be considered as search methods that operate on lower-level heuristics or heuristic components, and can be categorised into two main classes: heuristic selection and heuristic generation. Here we will focus on the first of these two categories, selection hyper-heuristics. This paper gives a brief history of this emerging area, reviews contemporary selection hyper-heuristic literature, and discusses recent selection hyper-heuristic frameworks. In addition, the existing classification of selection hyper-heuristics is extended, in order to reflect the nature of the challenges faced in contemporary research. Unlike the survey on hyper-heuristics published in 2013, this paper focuses only on selection hyper-heuristics and presents critical discussion, current research trends and directions for future research.}

abstract = {This paper introduces multi-directional local search, a metaheuristic for multi-objective optimization. We first motivate the method and present an algorithmic framework for it. We then apply it to several known multi-objective problems such as the multi-objective multi-dimensional knapsack problem, the bi-objective set packing problem and the bi-objective orienteering problem. Experimental results show that our method systematically provides solution sets of comparable quality with state-of-the-art methods applied to benchmark instances of these problems, within reasonable CPU effort. We conclude that the proposed algorithmic framework is a viable option when solving multi-objective optimization problems.}

abstract = { In this paper, an improved sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic method for the Air Liquide inventory routing problem, the subject of the ROADEF/EURO 2016 challenge, is described. The organizers of the challenge have proposed a real-world problem of inventory routing as a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. An exact method often fails to find a feasible solution to such problems. On the other hand, heuristics may be able to find a good quality solution that is significantly better than those produced by an expert human planner. There is a growing interest toward self-configuring automated general-purpose reusable heuristic approaches for combinatorial optimization. Hyper-heuristics have emerged as such methodologies. This paper investigates a new breed of hyper-heuristics based on the principles of sequence analysis to solve the inventory routing problem. The primary point of this work is that it shows the usefulness of the improved sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic, and in particular demonstrates the advantages of using a data science technique of hidden Markov model for the heuristic selection. }
