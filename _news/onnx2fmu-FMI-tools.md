We are excited to announce that [ONNX2FMU](https://github.com/HyRES-FBK/onnx2fmu) is now listed on the official [FMI Tool page](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/). This tool allows you to embed ONNX models into co-simulation Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs). Check out the [usage examples](https://github.com/HyRES-FBK/onnx2fmu/tree/master/examples) to get started.
